      <p>Power electronics is the application of electronics to the control and conversion of electric power. ... In modern systems, the conversion is performed with semiconductor switching devices such as diodes, thyristors, and power transistors such as the power MOSFET and IGBT.
This forms four basic types of power electronics circuits shown in the figure below

    <p>The power system is a network which consists generation, distribution and transmission system. It uses the form of energy (like coal and diesel) and converts it into electrical energy. ... The power plant generates the power which is step-up or step-down through the transformer for transmission.

    <p> electrical engineering, a transmission line is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct electromagnetic waves in a contained manner. The term applies when the conductors are long enough that the wave nature of the transmission must be taken into account.
